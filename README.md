# Write an Algorithm for a Dog Identification App

### 1. Installation
You need install **nltk**, **sklearn**, **plotly**，**keras**，**glob**，**tqdm**，**cv2** and **PIL** libraries. Besides, no need to install additional libraries other than Python integrated in Anaconada.The code should run using Python 3.* .
  
### 2. Project Motivation
This repo contains all my work for the capstone project of Data Scientist Nanodegree. In this project, I have learned how to build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, my algorithm will identify an estimate of the canine’s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed. This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)! In this prject I have completed a list of task below:
1. Assess the Human Face Detector. 
2. Assess the Dog Detector.
3. Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (from Scratch).
4. Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)
5. Write the dog breed ideitify Algorithm
6. Test the Algorithm

### 3.File Descriptions
There are a jupyter notebook and a html file.
1. `dog_app.ipynb`  
* This file is the main work I have done, in this file I have build a CNN to classify dog breeds from Scratch and using Transfer Learning.
2. ` dog_app.html `
* The copy of the file `dog_app.ipynb` in html format.
